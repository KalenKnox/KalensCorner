            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>My childhood was perfectly normal, except for having one of the 
                oldest diseases known to man: epilepsy. <em>Idiopathic</em>, 
                of unknown origin, is how I got it. I was not born with it and
                as far as we know it was not induced from some sort of trauma.
                One day, about five years old, I had a fit at my baby-sitter's
                house, Betsy. And, just like that, I was epileptic!
            </p>
            <p>Nothing changed from my perspective, that would come later,
                about five years later. We moved from our home on Red Bridge Rd.
                in Kansas City, MO, to an odd place called Peculiar, MO. I did
                not think I would lose all of my friends--it wasn't that far, was it?
                Alas, that is not how the world works and I barely saw or heard from
                them again, for now.
            </p>
            <p>This is my first memory of becoming a loner. I did not play with
                the new kids during recess, preferring to collect rocks, and kiss
                my crush through the sliding tube, but I still did well enough
                academically, and I prided myself on being the only one in my class
                that asked to go to the library when I was done with my work, so I 
                could bring back a book and read, "Encyclopedia Brown" of course.
                Then, change really came: Middle School.
            </p>
            <p>Now, my grades started to suffer with my social life. I thought it
                was just me. I thought I was just dumb. I did not know a cloud 
                had engulfed my pysche and cognitive faculty. I did not know I was
                drugged by medication that was supposed to be helping me until the fog
                lifted, but the damage was done.
            </p>
            <p>I barely graduated high-school with less than 2.0 GPA and maybe an
                extra credit to my name, but the fog was starting to subside my 
                senior year as I was weaned off the medication that was the culprit.
                I had no had a seizure in a couple years (Last seizure: March 26, 1998),
                but that did not improve my academics--it was the drugs. Suddenly, 
                I was sober, found computers, and less than two years after graduating
                near the bottom of the high-school barrel I was graduating at the top
                of my class with a cumulitive 4.0 and a two-year degree(Associate's) 
                in computer programming technology. Things were looking up.
